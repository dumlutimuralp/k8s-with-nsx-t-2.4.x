The goal of this series of posts is to outline and explain the steps to integrate VMware NSX-T Platform to Kubernetes control plane. 

Software components used are shown below.

- vCenter 6.7 U1b (Build 11727113)
- ESX 6.7 U2 (Build 13006603)
- NSX-T 2.4.1 (Build 13716579)
- NSX Container Plugin 2.4.1 (Build 13515827)
- Ubuntu Server 16.04.5
- Docker CE 18.09.6
- Kubernetes 1.14.2
- Open vSwitch 2.10.2.13185890

It is highly recommended to check the following resources for compatibility requirements
* VMware Product Interoperability Matrices  
https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&175=&2=&1=
* NSX Container Plugin 2.4.1 Release Notes     
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4.1/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-241-Release-Notes.html

This series does **NOT** provide the generic intro level information on NSX-T or K8S. To have a basic understanding of NSX-T please watch the VMworld session recordings. Similarly for K8S, Pluralsight and A Cloud Guru trainings by Nigel Poulton and Udemy trainings by Mumshad Mannambeth is highly recommended.

Below articles focus on the management and data plane integration principles of NSX-T and K8S.
